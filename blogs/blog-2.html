      <h1>Mind the Gap: Why Whitespace Isn't Just Empty Space</h1>

      <h2>Keeping Tabs on Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        Ever thought about whitespace while programming? Probably not. Atleast I
        didn’t until recently. Yet whitespace is a core part of writing text and
        consequently code. Let’s explore an example to see why it matters. What
        does the following code do?
      </p>

      <pre><code>function greet(name){if(name){console.log("Hello, "+name+"!");}else{console.log("Hello, stranger!");}}greet("Alice");</code></pre>

      <p>
        Can't be bothered to read this? Me neither so let's add some whitespace
        to make this more readable:
      </p>

      <pre
        style="tab-size: 2"
      ><code>function greet(name) {&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (name) {&#10;&#9;&#9;console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else {&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello, stranger!");&#10;&#9;}&#10;}&#10;&#10;greet("Alice");</code></pre>

      <p>
        Much better! And yes, both examples are completely valid JavaScript. But
        without whitespace even the simplest code block can turn into a cryptic
        nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
        So problem solved. All you need to do is add some whitespaces and tabs
        make it look good and you can happily share your code with everyone
        right? right?
      </p>

      <pre
        style="tab-size: 8"
      ><code>function greet(name) {&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (name) {&#10;&#9;&#9;console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else {&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello, stranger!");&#10;&#9;}&#10;}&#10;&#10;greet("Alice");</code></pre>

      <p>
        Your colleague opens the code… and something feels off. What looked
        perfectly neat on your editor now looks like a chaotic mess. The
        culprit? Mixed tabs and spaces for indentation. You, blissfully coding
        in VSCode with a tab-size of 2, matched your spaces just fine, but your
        gigachad colleague is rocking bare-metal Vim with a tab-size of 8.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins of the Void</h2>
      <p>
        Ok, so now we know why whitespace does matter at least for readability
        we need to maybe take a look at what whitespace actually is. According
        to our dear friend ChatGPT "Whitespace refers to any character or series
        of characters in text that represent horizontal or vertical space but do
        not produce a visible symbol. They are used primarily for formatting,
        separation, and readability". There are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character"
          >far too many whitespace characters</a
        >
        which I will not dive deeper into. Instead I'll to focus on the
        whitespace characters that matter most to programmers: tabs, space and
        the new-line character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spaces first appeared in written language to separate words and became
        standard on 19th-century typewriters. Tabs appeared later in the
        century, invented to align text into neat columns. Typewriters used a
        “tab stop” system, letting the carriage slide to preset stops for quick
        formatting, eliminating the need to insert spaces manually. Newlines
        (line breaks) came with teletypes and early printers, signaling “end of
        line, please return”, embodied in carriage return (CR) and line feed
        (LF) control characters. As computing evolved, these made their way into
        early character sets like ASCII (1963), where SPACE, TAB, CR, and LF
        became official control characters. This legacy lives on in programming:
        spaces separate tokens, tabs align code blocks, and newlines keep code
        neatly organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many languages such as Java, C or JavaScript whitespace is purely
        used for better readability. But in some languages, such as Python,
        whitespace is part of the syntax itself. Python’s use of whitespace
        makes code more concise, letting programmers define scope without
        brackets <code style="display: inline; padding: 0.1rem">{}</code>,
        parentheses <code style="display: inline; padding: 0.1rem">()</code>, or
        special keywords like
        <code style="display: inline; padding: 0.1rem">if ... end</code>. Fun
        fact if you mix spaces and tabs as indentation in Python it will throw
        an error. The most extreme example of whitespace as syntax is an
        esoteric language called

        <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
          >Whitespace</a
        >, which uses nothing but spaces, tabs, and line breaks to write
        programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Closing the Gap</h2>
      <p>
        That said, you don’t need to become a whitespace fanatic. Thankfully,
        formatters do most of the heavy lifting: trimming trailing spaces and
        avoiding mixed indentation. You can even make your editor show them. In
        Neovim you can, for example, toggle rendering whitespace with
        <code style="display: inline; padding: 0.1rem">:set list</code> and
        <code style="display: inline; padding: 0.1rem">:set list!</code>. To
        avoid a whitespace mess, set up your tooling and development environment
        properly. Just remember to configure it for each language, since every
        language has its own whitespace quirks and conventions.
      </p>

      <h2>How Nothing Taught Me Something</h2>
      <p>
        What got me thinking about whitespace intentionally was an internship I
        did. As usual, I was handed a brand-new machine, but since the
        internship was brief, I skipped fully setting up my development
        environment the way I normally would. I dove straight in, coding in Vim
        without plugins or formatters. My first <em><b>!six!</b></em> merge
        requests were rejected, all due to mixed tabs and spaces or trailing
        whitespace. At first, I was frustrated. Why fuss over indentation or
        spaces? But after thinking about it for a while, I slowly realized why
        senior colleagues insisted on it. Whitespace characters are just like
        any other, except most IDEs don’t render them. That makes them easy to
        mix up, but to a computer, a space, a tab, and a letter are all distinct
        characters. Just as you carefully name variables and fix typos to avoid
        bugs, you should handle whitespace with intent. In my case, sloppy
        whitespace made my colleague’s life harder. Different tab-size settings
        messed up the code’s appearance, and trailing spaces cluttered git
        diffs, drawing attention away from the logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of whitespace is to make code easier to read. If you
        notice it too much, it probably means something is off. Don't ignore it,
        be intentional. Because:
